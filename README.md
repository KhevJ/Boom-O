# üí£ Boom-O: Distributed Multiplayer UNO Game

Boom-O is a distributed multiplayer UNO game developed using Unity and C#. This project integrates key concepts from distributed systems, including:

- **Consistency**
- **Fault Tolerance**
- **Passive Replication**
- **Leader Server Switching**
- **Socket.IO Communication**
- **Synchronization Across Servers and Clients**

## üß© Features

- **Multiplayer Gameplay**: Engage in UNO matches with multiple players across different devices.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Ensures game state consistency and fault tolerance through passive replication and leader election mechanisms.
- **Real-time Communication**: Utilizes Socket.IO for seamless real-time interactions between clients and servers.
- **Server Synchronization**: Maintains synchronized game data across multiple servers to enhance reliability and performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Game development platform.
- **C#**: Primary programming language.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
- **Distributed Systems Principles**: Implemented from scratch to handle replication, consistency, and fault tolerance.
